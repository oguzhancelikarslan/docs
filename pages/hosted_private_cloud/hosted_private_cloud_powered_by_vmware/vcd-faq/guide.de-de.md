### How migration will be done by OVHcloud ?

If you choose to migrate to VCD, OVHcloud will be handling the migration for you.

As an exception, we won’t be charging the new current server/host prices during the migration process. We’ll absorb the costs of the license price increase while the migration is ongoing. Whether or not you choose to continue using the current solution, you will still benefit from the new VCD prices right away, starting on May 1st 2024.

However, our goal is to migrate to VCD as soon as we’re ready. We’ll notify you 1 to 2 weeks before your migration starts, which will be carried out with zero downtime. If, for technical reasons, a live migration cannot be done, we’ll discuss with you how to proceed best.

### How are you migrating my data to VCD ?

Your data stays on the Leclerc v3 filers, we will expose to VCD the storage like we are exposing the storage to vSphere. The "live" migration between two hosts with the same CPU (Intel) is done via vMotion.

### Can I still have access to vSphere ESXi and vCenter API with VMware Cloud Director ?

With VMware Cloud Director, you cannot access to vSphere ESXi and vCenter API. You will have access to Cloud Director API, and you can use tools such as Terraform.

### Can I still use products like Veeam, Naviko, Rubik to backup my VMs ?

No, with VMware Cloud Director, you cannot use tools that request access to vSphre ESXi or vCenter.

For Backup, we will propose Veeam Managed Backup with an integrated plugin for Backup VMs.
We will propose 3 types of jobs by default, but you can add different policies if you need.

Consumption will be based per VMs per Month and storage consumption per month.

### Can I use rules such as affinity and anti-affinity as previously used with vSphere ?

With VMware Cloud Director, you are able to set group affinity for Virtual Machines and rules such as anti-affinity to separate different virtual machines.

<a name="certifications"></a>

### Which certifications apply to the new VCD service ?

At the service launch, no specific certification will be applicable to the VMware Cloud Director by OVHcloud service.

However, supporting HDS, ISO27001, SOC2 or PCI-DSS certifications are clearly our roadmap objectives.
